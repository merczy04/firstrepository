    <p class="font2">
      Sir Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955 in London, England. He is a
      British computer scientist, generally credited as the inventor of the
      World Wide Web. In 2004 he was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II
      of the United Kingdom and the inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (â‚¬1
      million) by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation.

    <p class="font2">
      Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his parents worked on
      the Ferranti Mark I, the first commercial computer. After graduating in
      1976 from the University of Oxford, Berners-Lee designed computer software
      for two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., located in Poole,
      Dorset, England. Following this, he had several positions in the computer
      industry, including a stint from June to December 1980 as a software
      engineering consultant at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory
      in Geneva.
